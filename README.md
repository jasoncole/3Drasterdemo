# 3Drasterdemo

Simple software implementation of a 3d Rasterizer. The goal of this project was to better understand 3D logic and the 3D graphics pipeline. This code is not performant as it is not intended as a finished product. Build using the Visual Studio compiler. See miscshell.bat and codebuild.bat for details.
